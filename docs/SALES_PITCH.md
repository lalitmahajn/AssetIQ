# AssetIQ – Sales Pitch

## Problem
Plants lose money due to:
- Unknown downtime
- Inconsistent reporting
- No single source of truth

## Why AssetIQ
AssetIQ records what actually happened.
No guessing. No manipulation.

## Core Line
“AssetIQ doesn’t guess.
It records the truth, compares plants, and shows where money is leaking.”

## How It Works
- Plant records events locally
- Truth is append‑only
- HQ only reads and compares

## Why It Scales
- One plant = one server
- HQ optional
- Works even with poor internet
